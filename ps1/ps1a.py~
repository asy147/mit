'''
 In Part A, we are going to determine how long it will take you to save enough
money to make the down payment given the following assumptions:
'''

annual_salary = int(input("starting annual salary: "))
portion_saved = float(input("portion of salary to be saved: "))
total_cost = float(input("cost of your dream home: "))
portion_down_payment = .25
current_savings = 0
r = 0.4
number_months = 0

while current_savings <= total_cost * portion_down_payment:
    current_savings = current_savings + annual_salary * portion_saved /12 + current_savings * r / 12
    number_months += 1
#    print(number_months)

print("\nNumber of months: ", number_months)
